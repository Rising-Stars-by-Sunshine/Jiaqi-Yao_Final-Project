### 1. Introduction and Background

The existing literature in game theory has primarily focused on analyzing strategic interactions between rational agents within well-defined and controlled environments. However, in the digital economy, where complex systems involve both human and AI agents, traditional game theory may not adequately capture the dynamics of decision-making, especially in scenarios involving trust, cooperation, and uncertainty. This gap in the literature is particularly pressing given the increasing integration of AI technologies into various aspects of our lives, raising questions about how humans and AI agents interact, cooperate, and compete within digital ecosystems.

### 2. Research Questions

My research question focused on how the integration of blockchain technology influences strategic interactions and outcomes in scenarios resembling the centipede game. This question is crucial for enhancing strategic interaction in digital transactions, potentially leading to more equitable economic outcomes. The literature gap is that traditional game theory does not fully account for trust and commitment issues in anonymous, decentralized digital settings.



### 3. Application Scenario

This framework applies to collaborative digital platforms like online marketplaces or automated trading systems where trust is crucial. In negotiation scenarios, such as business deals or labor disputes, parties may face decisions similar to those in the centipede game. Each decision to cooperate or defect affects the outcome and future interactions. Insights from behavioral economics, particularly related to trust and reputation systems (Axelrodâ€™s evolution of cooperation), provide a foundation for this research. 

### 4. Methodology

The methodology builds upon classical game theory, using the centipede game as a primary model. Under traditional Nash Equilibrium, the game will only end at the starting point for rational players. I aim to design a mechanism that a blockchain system offering smart contracts to each player that maximize the profit for rational players as long as they accept the contract. For fairness, the system will take part of the benefit and make the final reward equally distributed for both parties. The tools I applied is the implementation of smart contracts on blockchain to simulate and enforce game strategies, with computational simulations to analyze outcomes. This may be an example that AI simulations solve the trust problem in bounded rationality and make game theory concepts closer to real-life examples.

### 5. Preliminary Results

One direct example would be that the output of the game increased a lot compared to traditional game theory. For individuals, enterprises and groups that would like to reach a negotiation with more safety and privacy, the dilemma caused by the centipede game was solved by the implementation of a smart contract This helps society reach more cooperation and create more win-win situations that create more benefits. Existing research on centipede game only tried to reassign the output in game design to urge rational players to cooperate, but that was not practical for complex real-life cooperations and my method conducts a more all-rounded approach.

### 6. Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts

My initial focus on cooperative strategies might overlook the role of competitive strategies which are also crucial for comprehensive economic analysis. The model may only solve for cooperation problems, while still lacking a full view of the complexity of the society. Furthermore, how to design each smart contract may be a problem since if we want to make a decentralized system without third parties, large amount of GAI deep learning are needed to automatically generate ideal contracts for all situations. However, my research Influences strategic decision-making in corporations and governments by providing mechanisms for reliable, enforceable cooperation in decentralized settings.
